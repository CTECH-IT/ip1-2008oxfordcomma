Dre Harm

As of now my goal will be trying to make an asteroid-style game like I made a while back a while ago in Unity.

v0.1 Added ship - Set up canvas and background - Trying out FPS 
v0.2 Added ship movement - added "fire" thrust at the rear of the ship when you are moving forward 
v0.3 Added Asteroids with random amounts of sizes, sides, and positions - stopped asteroids from spawning on the player - 
Added "jaggedness" to the asteroids - added asteroid movement

Stuff I need to do: 
- Make a ship
    - Possible ship customization
- Control the ship 
    - Key presses
    - Maybe mouse controls
- Projectiles
    - Upgrades to projectiles?
    - Cool down to prevent spam?
- Make asteroids
- Collision
    - Between Ship and Asteroids
    - Between Asteroids and Projectiles
- Score 
    - Either how long you were alive or amount of asteroids
- Game over Screen
- Extra Stuff
    - Power ups 
        -Shield
