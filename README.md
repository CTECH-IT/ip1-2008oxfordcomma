Dre Harm

As of now my goal will be trying to make an asteroid-style game like I made a while back a while ago in Unity.

v0.1 Added ship - Set up canvas and background - Trying out FPS 
v0.2 Added ship movement - added "fire" thrust at the rear of the ship when you are moving forward 
v0.3 Added Asteroids with random amounts of sizes, sides, and positions - stopped asteroids from spawning on the player - Added "jaggedness" to the asteroids - added asteroid movement 
v0.4 Added collision detection bounds - added collsion and explosion when in contact with asteroid - ship respawns after a little bit of time after collision - add invulnerability when first starting to avoid dying when spawning on top of an asteroid - invulnerability is indicated by the ship flashing like in the original asteroids game
v0.5 Centered canvas - Added controls for shooting - added lasers that shoot from the nose of the ship - added a max distance for the lasers - added looping if a projectile hits the edge of the canvas - asteroids dissapper on hit and so do the lasers
v0.6 Added text when a new level starts that displays the current level, added lives counter, added game over, added score


Stuff I need to do: 
- Make a ship
    - Possible ship customization
- Score 
    - Based on how long you were alive
