Dre Harm

As of now my goal will be trying to make an asteroid-style game like I made a while back a while ago in Unity.

v0.1 

Stuff I need to do: 
- Make a ship
    - Possible ship customization
- Control the ship 
    - Key presses
    - Maybe mouse controls
- Projectiles
    - Upgrades to projectiles?
    - Cool down to prevent spam?
- Make asteroids
- Collision
    - Between Ship and Asteroids
    - Between Asteroids and Projectiles
- Score 
    - Either how long you were alive or amount of asteroids
- Game over Screen
- Extra Stuff
    - Indicator to show the nose of the ship
        - Maybe a dot?
    - Power ups 
        -Shield
